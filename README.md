# Eat & Keep (front-end)

### Live site: _coming soon_

An app to track the restaurants I've eaten at in NYC.

_more details coming soon_

#### Goals of this project:

- Set up a client-facing application using Angular
- Tap into the Yelp! API for business data using the Apollo client and GraphQL
- Concurrently run the front-end and back-end in my dev environment

#### Local installation:

1. Create a new folder
2. Clone this repo and the project's back-end repo into the new folder (keep them separated)
3. Install all dependencies for both projects individually by running `npm install` in each folder
4. Navigate into this project's folder via your CLI and boot the project with `npm start`
